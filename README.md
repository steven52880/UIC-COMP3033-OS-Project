My implementation of final project of UIC course "COMP3033 Operating Systems"

Please run the following command on linux:

1. Install environment: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install cmake build-essential`

2. Run `bash run.sh`

Because there is a limit on the formate and number of file that can be uploaded to Moodle, I need to combine all source files and header files into one file. The combined file is in the `src_combined` folder.
